# About Me, and My Bird Nest
My name, Qiu Qin, pronounces like "Chiu Chin". 

I got my PhD in Electrical Engineering at the end of 2015. I am currently a Bioinformatician at Duke University. 

I work on simulation, modeling, web applications and databases. I like traveling, running and taking photos. 

See my [CV](/CV "Qiu's CV").

## My Name
Thanks to my parents. I always feel my names are elegant as you can rotate the "u" to get an "n". In Chinese, my first name comes from the first piece of the "[*Classic of Poetry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry)", the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry. And my last name can be found in the second piece of it.

In 2017, as I have been working on the Python-Django framework for a while and Google App Engine seems to be more reliable, I decided to "renovate" my bird nest with Python-Django.

### My Blog, Swift

Now the MSN live space is no longer live, and Swift have been moved to Wordpress. I haven't really write anything since I started my PhD. Working towards a PhD does not keep me busy. There are just so many distractions...

### My Work, Sparrow
Sparrow was used to host my works, with a history that can be traced back to 2009. Linkedin was not that popular at that time, so I also ask Sparrow to pick up my resume. When looking at the history of Sparrow, I see the ideas are changing so rapidly...

### My Gallery, Skylark
The Skylark Gallery displays some of my insteresting photos. Skylark started as the name of my Flickr. I used to use Apreture to manage my photos and sync them with Flickr. As Apple no longer update Aperture, I moved my pictures to Lightroom. Since then, I was too lazy to reconnect Flickr...

### My Footprint, Swan
Swan is young, she enjoy the leisure time with me on the map...
