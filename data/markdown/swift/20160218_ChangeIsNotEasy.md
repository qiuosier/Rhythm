I believe, for most people, once they get used to something, they don't like changes. Or, I should say, they don't like big changes. Think of my mum, She doesn't really care whether her cellphone is an iphone or a Nokia. Learning how to use an iphone doesn't seem to be easy for her. Sometimes I have a feeling that, most new products are for young people. Because they don't have a lot of experience, or assets, they are willing to try new things.

When we really have some in our hands, like a Nokia phone, we don't really care if Nokia is still supporting it. We can still use the phone happly. However, when it comes to software, or service, losing support might become a big trouble. Google is retiring Picasa. Apple retired Aperture. Microsoft retired live space...long time ago. These things are managing our assets, once they are no long getting support, we will need to find something new to replace them, or move to what they have suggested...I don't use Picasa, and I like Google photos. But...as we are moving thing to the cloud, we need to carefully think of a problem. What if the cloud is gone?
