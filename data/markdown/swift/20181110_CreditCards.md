# Which Credit Card I Should Use to Get Max Rewards?

_November 10th, 2018_

A few years ago, I was pretty good at remembering which credit card to use in order to maximize the rewards. As I am getting more and more credit cards, things become complicated. So I decided to make a table for them. Actually I asked the computer to make this table. There are many credit card blogs or websites making recommendations for the hot deals.

## My Credit Card Rewards Table
Following the most recent table based on my valuation of the points and miles.

## Miles and Points
For cashback rewards, we can simply compare the cash value. However, miles and points all have different values. Most of them seem to value more than cash, but only if collect and use them for your needs.
